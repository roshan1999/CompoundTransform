      "1. Following indictment alleging violation of federal statutes by certain staff members of the White House and political supporters of the President, the Special Prosecutor filed a motion under Fed.\n",
      "2. Proc. 17(c) for a subpoena  for the production before trial of certain tapes and documents relating to precisely identified conversations and meetings between the President and others.\n",
      "3. the President, claiming executive privilege, filed a motion to quash the subpoena.\n",
      "4. The District Court thereafter issued an order for an  examination of the subpoenaed material, having rejected the President's contentions (a) that the dispute between the President and the Special Prosecutor was nonjusticiable as an \"intra-executive\" conflict and (b) that the Judiciary lacked authority to review the President's assertion of executive privilege.\n",
      "5. The District Court stayed The District Court order pending appellate review, which the President then sought in the Court of Appeals.\n",
      "6. The District Court a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment (No. 73-1766), and the President filed a cross-petition for such a writ challenging the grand jury action (No. 73-1834).\n",
      "7. Such an exception is proper in the unique circumstances of this case, where it would be inappropriate to subject the President to the procedure of securing review by resisting an order for an  examination of the subpoenaed material and inappropriate to require that The District Court proceed by a traditional contempt citation in order to provide appellate review.\n",
      "8. The dispute between the Special Prosecutor and the President presents a justiciable controversy.\n",
      "9. The action of the Special Prosecutor within the scope of the Special Prosecutor express authority seeking specified evidence preliminarily determined to be relevant and admissible in the pending criminal case, and the President's assertion of privilege in opposition thereto, present issues \"of a type which are traditionally justiciable,\"  at 430, and the fact that both litigants are officers of the Executive Branch is not a bar to justiciability.\n",
      "10. Neither the doctrine of separation of powers nor the generalized need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.\n",
      "11. Absent a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets, the confidentiality of  Presidential communications is not significantly diminished by producing material for a criminal trial under the protected conditions of  inspection, and any absolute executive privilege under Art.\n",
      "12. Although the courts will afford the utmost deference to Presidential acts in the performance of an Art.\n",
      "13. (No. 14,694), when a claim of Presidential privilege as to materials subpoenaed for use in a criminal trial is based, as it is here, not on the ground that military or diplomatic secrets are implicated, but merely on the ground of a generalized interest in confidentiality, the President's generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial and the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.\n",
      "14. Since a president's communications encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of an ordinary individual, the public interest requires that Presidential confidentiality be afforded the greatest protection consistent with the fair administration of justice, and this Court has a heavy responsibility to ensure that material involving Presidential conversations irrelevant to or inadmissible in the criminal prosecution be accorded the high degree of respect due a President, and that such material be returned under seal to this Court lawful custodian.\n",
      "15. This litigation presents for review the denial of a motion, filed in this Court on behalf of the President of the United States, in the case of\n",
      "16. a third-party subpoena  issued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia directed the President of the United States to produce certain tape recordings and documents relating to the President of the United States conversations with aides and advisers.\n",
      "17. this Court rejected the President of the United States's claims of absolute executive privilege, of lack of jurisdiction, and of failure to satisfy the requirements of Rule 17(c).\n",
      "18. the President of the United States appealed to this Court.\n",
      "19. We granted both the United States petition for certiorari before judgment (No. 7 1766), [n1] and also the President's cross-petition for certiorari  before judgment (No.\n",
      "20. because of the public importance of the issues presented and the need for the United States' petition for certiorari before judgment (No. 7 1766), [n1] and also the President's cross-petition for certiorari  before judgment\n",
      "21. Although he was not designated as such in an indictment charging seven named individuals [n3] with various offenses, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and to obstruct justice, the grand jury named the President, among others, as an unindicted coconspirator.\n",
      "22. On April 18, 1974, upon motion of the Special  was issued pursuant to Rule 17(c) to the President of the United States by this Court and made returnable on May 2, 1974.\n",
      "23. This subpoena required the production, in advance of the September 9 trial date, of certain tapes, memoranda, papers, transcripts, or other writings relating to certain precisely identified meetings between the President and others.\n",
      "24. On April 30, the President of the United States publicly released edited transcripts of 43 conversations; portions of 20 conversations subject to subpoena in the present case were included.\n",
      "25. On May 1, 1974, the President of the United States's counsel filed a \"special appearance\" and a motion to quash This subpoena under Rule 17(c).\n",
      "26. At a subsequent hearing, [n6] further motions to expunge the grand jury's action naming the President of the United States as an unindicted coconspirator and for protective orders against the disclosure of that information were filed or raised orally by counsel for the President of the United States.\n",
      "27. the District Court further ordered \"the President or any subordinate officer, official, or employee with custody or control of the documents or  at 1331, to deliver to the District Court, on or before May 31, 1974, the originals of all subpoenaed items, as well as an index and analysis of those items, together with tape copies of those portions of the subpoenaed recordings for which transcripts had been released to the public by the President of the United States on April 30.\n",
      "28. the District Court rejected jurisdictional challenges based on a contention that the dispute was nonjusticiable because the dispute was between The Special Prosecutor and the Chief Executive and hence \"intra-executive\" in character; the District Court also rejected the contention that the Judiciary was without authority to review an assertion of executive privilege by the President of the United States.\n",
      "29. the District Court held that the judiciary, not the President, was the final arbiter of a claim of executive privilege.\n",
      "30. On May 24, 1974, the President of the United States filed a timely notice of appeal from the District Court order, and the certified record from the District Court was docketed in the United\n",
      "31. On the same day, the President of the United States also filed a petition for writ of mandamus in this Court seeking review of the District Court order.\n",
      "32. On June 6, the President of the United States filed, under seal, a cross-petition for writ of certiorari before judgment.\n",
      "33. To require a President of the United States to place a President of the United States in the posture of disobeying an order of a court merely to trigger the procedural mechanism for review of the ruling would be  unseemly, and would present an unnecessary occasion for constitutional confrontation between two branches of the Government.\n",
      "34. Similarly, a federal judge should not be placed in the posture of issuing a citation to a President simply in order to invoke review.\n",
      "35. The issue whether a President can be cited for contempt could a President can be cited for contempt engender protracted litigation, and would further delay both review on the merits of a President claim of privilege and the ultimate termination of the underlying criminal action for which a President evidence is sought.\n",
      "36. In the District Court, the President of the United States's counsel argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to issue the subpoena because the matter was an intra-branch dispute between a subordinate and superior officer of the Executive Branch, and hence not subject to judicial resolution.\n",
      "37. the President's counsel argues that the federal courts should not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of Government.\n",
      "38. the President's counsel views the dispute as essentially a \"jurisdictional\" dispute within the Executive Branch which the President's counsel analogizes to a dispute between two congressional committees.\n",
      "39. Since the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case,  342 F.2d 167, 171 (CA5),  (1965), it is contended that a President's decision is final in determining what evidence is to be used in a given criminal case.\n",
      "40. Although the President's counsel concedes that the President of the United States ha delegated certain specific powers to the Special Prosecutor, his has notwaived nor delegated to The Special Prosecutor the President of the United States's duty to claim privilege as to all materials . .\n",
      "41. which fall within the President of the United States's inherent authority to refuse to disclose to any executive officer.\n",
      "42. Brief for the President 42.\n",
      "43. The Special Prosecutor's demand for the items therefore presents, in the view of the President of the United States's counsel, a political question under\n",
      "44. Moreover, the delegation of authority to the Special Prosecutor in this case is not an ordinary delegation by the Attorney General to a subordinate officer:  with the authorization of the President of the United States, the Attorney General provided in the regulation that the Special Prosecutor was not to be removed without the \"consensus\" of eight designated leaders of Congress.\n",
      "45. the production or nonproduction of specified evidence deemed by the Special Prosecutor to be relevant and admissible in a pending criminal case is sought by one official of the Executive Branch within the scope of his express authority; the production or nonproduction of specified evidence deemed by the Special Prosecutor to be relevant and admissible in a pending criminal case is resisted by the Chief Executive on the ground of his duty to preserve the confidentiality of the communications of the President of the United States.\n",
      "46. The independent Special Prosecutor, with his asserted need for the subpoenaed material in the underlying criminal prosecution, is opposed by the President of the United States, with his steadfast assertion of privilege against disclosure of the material.\n",
      "47. a case such as this, however, where a subpoena is directed to a President of the United States, appellate review, in deference to a coordinate branch of Government, should be particularly meticulous to ensure that the standards of Rule 17(c) have been correctly applied.\n",
      "48. From our examination of the materials submitted by the Special Prosecutor to the District Court in support of the Special Prosecutor motion for a pretrial subpoena  , our are persuaded that the District Court denial of the President of the United States's motion to quash a pretrial subpoena   was consistent with Rule 17(c).\n",
      "49. IVTHE CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE AHaving determined that the requirements of Rule 17(c) were satisfied, we turn to the claim that a pretrial subpoena   should be quashed because a pretrial subpoena   demands \"confidential conversations between a President and PRIVILEGE AHaving close advisors that it would be inconsistent with the public interest to produce.\n",
      "50. The first contention is a broad claim that the separation of powers doctrine precludes judicial review of a President's claim of privilege.\n",
      "51. the President of the United States's counsel, as we have noted, reads the Constitution as providing an absolute privilege of confidentiality for all Presidential communications.\n",
      "52. No holding of the District Court has defined the scope of judicial power specifically relating to the enforcement of a subpoena for confidential Presidential communications for use in a criminal prosecution, but other exercises of power by the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch have been found invalid as in conflict with the Constitution.   series of cases, the District Court interpreted the explicit immunity conferred by express provisions of the Constitution on Members of the House and Senate by the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S.Const.\n",
      "53. § 1, of the Constitution can no more be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief Executive, for example, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share with the Judiciary the power to override a Presidential veto.\n",
      "54. In support of his claim of absolute privilege, the President of the United States's counsel urges two grounds, one of which is common to all governments and one of which is peculiar to our system of separation of powers.\n",
      "55. Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art.\n",
      "56. II powers, the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within II own assigned area of constitutional duties.\n",
      "57. [n16] the protection of the confidentiality of  Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings.\n",
      "58. The second ground asserted by the President's counsel in support of the claim of absolute privilege rests on the doctrine of separation of powers.\n",
      "59. Here it is argued that the independence of the Executive Branch within the Executive Branch own sphere, , 190-191 (1881), insulates a President from a judicial subpoena in an ongoing criminal prosecution, and thereby protects confidential Presidential communications.\n",
      "60. However, neither the doctrine of separation of powers nor the need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.\n",
      "61. The President's need for complete candor and objectivity from advisers calls for great deference from the courts.\n",
      "62. However, when the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art depends solely on the broad, undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such conversations, a confrontation with other values arises.\n",
      "63. Absent a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets, we find it difficult to accept the argument that even the very important interest in confidentiality of Presidential communications is significantly diminished by production of such material for  inspection with all the protection that a district court will be obliged to provide.\n",
      "64. II powers of The President as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and nondiplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of \"a workable government\" and gravely impair the role of the courts under Art.\n",
      "65. we conclude that the legitimate needs of the judicial process may outweigh Presidential privilege, it is necessary to resolve those competing interests in a manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch.\n",
      "66. The right and indeed the duty to resolve that question does not free the Judiciary from according high respect to the representations made on behalf of The President.\n",
      "67. The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of a President conversations and correspondence, like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations, for example, has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens, is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decisionmaking.\n",
      "68. A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions, and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately.\n",
      "69. These are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications.\n",
      "70. a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications is fundamental to the operation of Government, and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.\n",
      "71. D.C. 58, 487 F.2d 700 (1973), the Court of Appeals held that such Presidential communications are \"presumptively privileged,\"  at 75, 487 F.2d at 717, and this position is accepted by both parties in the present litigation.\n",
      "72. We agree with Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's observation, therefore, that \"[i]n no case of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall kind would a court be required to proceed against The President as against an ordinary individual.\"\n",
      "73. But a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications must be considered in light of our historic commitment to the rule of law.\n",
      "74. [n18]In this case, The President challenges a subpoena served on The President as a third party requiring the production of materials for use in a criminal prosecution; The President does so on the claim that The President has a privilege against disclosure of confidential communications.\n",
      "75. The President does not place The President claim of privilege on the ground they are military or diplomatic secrets.\n",
      "76. II duties, the courts have traditionally shown the utmost deference to Presidential responsibilities.\n",
      "77. In , 111 (1948), dealing with Presidential authority involving foreign policy considerations, the District Court said:The President, both as Commander-in-Chief and as the Nation's organ for foreign affairs, has available intelligence services whose reports are not and ought not to be published to the world.\n",
      "78. When this is the case, the occasion for a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications is appropriate, and the District Court should not jeopardize the security which a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications is meant to protect by insisting upon an examination of the evidence, even by the judge alone, in chambers.\n",
      "79. No case of the District Court, however, has extended this high degree of deference to a President's generalized interest in confidentiality.\n",
      "80. Nowhere in the Constitution, as we have noted earlier, is there any explicit reference to a privilege of confidentiality, yet to the extent this interest relates to the effective discharge of a President's powers, it is constitutionally based.\n",
      "81. In No case of the Court, we must weigh the importance of the general privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in performance of The President's responsibilities against the inroads of such a privilege on the fair  administration of criminal justice.\n",
      "82. [n20]On the other hand, the allowance of a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications to withhold evidence that is demonstrably relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely impair the basic function of the District Court.\n",
      "83. A President's acknowledged need for confidentiality  in the communications of A President office is general in nature, whereas the constitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding is specific and central to the fair adjudication of a particular criminal case in the administration of justice.\n",
      "84. The President's broad interest in confidentiality of communications will not be vitiated by disclosure of a limited number of conversations preliminarily shown to have some bearing on the pending criminal cases.\n",
      "85. If a President concludes that compliance with a subpoena would be injurious to the public interest, a President may properly, as was done here, invoke a claim of privilege on the return of the subpoena.\n",
      "86. We now turn to the important question of the District Court responsibilities in conducting the  examination of Presidential materials or communications delivered under the compulsion of the subpoena Enforcement of the subpoena\n",
      "87. the issues raised by the petitions for certiorari now having been disposed of, the matter of implementation will rest with the District Court.[T]he guard, furnished to [the President] to protect [the President] from being harassed by vexatious and unnecessary subpoenas, is to be looked for in the conduct of a [district] court after those subpoenas have issued; not in any circumstance which is to precede those subpoenas have issued being issued.\n",
      "88. That being true of an ordinary situation, it is obvious that the District Court has  a very heavy responsibility to see to the District Court that Presidential conversations, which are either not relevant or not admissible, are accorded that high degree of respect due the President of the United States.\n",
      "89. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, sitting as a trial judge in the  was extraordinarily careful to point out that[i]n no case of this kind would a court be required to proceed against The President as against an ordinary individual.25 F.Cas. at 192.\n",
      "90. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's statement cannot be read to mean in any sense that a President is above the law, but relates to the singularly unique role under Art.\n",
      "91. II of a President's communications and activities, related to the performance of duties under that Article.\n",
      "92. Moreover, a President's communications and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of any \"ordinary individual.\n",
      "93. It is therefore necessary [n21] in the public interest to afford Presidential confidentiality the greatest protection consistent with the fair administration of justice.\n",
      "94. We have no doubt that the District Judge will at all times accord to Presidential records that high degree of deference suggested in  and will discharge\n",
      "95. The cross-petition in No. 73-1824 raised the issue whether the grand jury acted within the grand jury authority in naming the President as an unindicted coconspirator.\n",
      "96. On June 19, 1974, the President's counsel moved for disclosure and transmittal to this Court of all evidence presented to the grand jury relating to this Court of all evidence presented to the grand jury relating to its action in naming the President as an unindicted coconspirator action in naming the President as an unindicted coconspirator.\n",
      "97. Each has occupied either a position of responsibility on the White House Staff or a position with the Committee for the Re-election of The President.\n",
      "98. The President entered a special appearance in the District Court on June 6 and requested the District Court to lift the District Court protective order regarding the naming of certain individuals as coconspirators and to any additional extent deemed appropriate by the District Court.\n",
      "99. On June 7, the District Court removed its protective order and, on June 10, counsel for both parties jointly moved the District Court the District Court to unseal those parts of the record which related to the action of the grand jury regarding The President.\n",
      "100. After receiving a statement in opposition from The seven defendants, the District Court the District Court denied this motion on June 15, 1974, except for the grand jury's immediate finding relating to the status of The President as an unindicted coconspirator.\n",
      "101. At the joint suggestion of the Special Prosecutor and counsel for The President, and with the approval of counsel for The seven defendants, further proceedings in the District Court were held  both parties have suggested that the District Court the District Court has jurisdiction on other grounds.\n",
      "102. The regulation issued by the Attorney General pursuant to the Attorney General statutory authority vests in the Special Prosecutor plenary authority to control the course of investigations and litigation related toall offenses arising out of the 1972 Presidential Election for which the Special Prosecutor deems it necessary and appropriate to assume responsibility, allegations involving The President, members of the White House Staff, or Presidential appointees, and any other matters which The President consents to have assigned to The President by the Attorney General.38 Fed.\n",
      "103. In accordance with assurances given by The President to the Attorney General that The President will not exercise The President Constitutional powers to effect the discharge of the Special Prosecutor or to limit the independence that The President is hereby given, the Special Prosecutor will not be removed from The President duties except for extraordinary improprieties on The President part and without The President's first consulting the Majority and the Minority Leaders and Chairmen and ranking Minority Members of the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and ascertaining that the Senate and House of Representatives consensus is in accord with The President proposed action.\n",
      "104. That this was the understanding of Acting Attorney General Robert Bork, the author of the regulation establishing the independence of the Special Prosecutor, is shown by The President testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee:Although it is anticipated that The President will receive cooperation from the White House in getting any evidence The President feels The President needs to conduct investigations and prosecutions, it is clear and understood on all sides that The President has the power to use judicial processes to pursue evidence if disagreement should develop.\n",
      "105. the Special Prosecutor argues that there is no provision in the Constitution for a Presidential privilege as to The President's communications corresponding to the privilege of Members of Congress under the Speech or Debate Clause.\n",
      "106. We are not here concerned with the balance between The President's generalized interest in confidentiality and the need for relevant evidence in civil litigation, nor with that between the confidentiality interest and congressional demands for information, nor with The President's interest in preserving state secrets.\n",
      "107. We address only the conflict between The President's assertion of a generalized privilege of confidentiality and the constitutional need for relevant evidence in criminal trials.\n",
      "108. When the subpoenaed material is delivered to the District Judge  questions may arise as to the excising of parts, and the excising of parts lies within the discretion of the District Court to seek the aid of the Special Prosecutor and The President's counsel for  consideration of the validity of particular excision, whether the basis of excision is relevancy or admissibility or under such cases as\n"

       "'ï»¿Place-names are marked in Arabic, and there are some well-known names like Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh (Qanauj).\\nBut look at the areas inland.\\nEqually important is the fact that the science of cartography differed in the two periods.\\nWhen historians read documents, maps and texts from the past they have to be sensitive to the different historical backgrounds the contexts in which information about the past was produced.\\nIf the context in which information is produced changes with time, what about language and meanings?\\nHistorical records exist in a variety of languages which have changed considerably over the years.\\nMedieval Persian, for example, is different from modern Persian.\\nThe difference is not just with regard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of words also change over time.\\nTake the term Hindustan, for example.\\nToday we understand it as India, the modern nation state.\\nWhen the term Hindustan was used in the thirteenth century by Minhaj-i-Siraj , Minhaj-i-Siraj meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna.\\n-Siraj used the term Hindustan in a political sense for lands that were a part of the dominions of the Delhi Sultan.\\nThe areas included in the term Hindustan shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but the term Hindustan never included south India within the term Hindustan.\\nBy contrast, in the early sixteenth century Babur used Hindustan to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent.\\nThis was somewhat similar to the way the fourteenth century poet Amir Khusrau used the word Hind.\\nWhile the idea of a geographical and cultural entity like India did exist, the term Hindustan did not carry the political and national meanings which we associate with the term Hindustan today.\\nHistorians have to be careful about the terms Historians use because Historians meant different things in the past.\\nTake for example a simple term like foreigner.\\nIt is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian.\\nIn the medieval period a foreigner was any stranger who appeared say in a given village, someone who was not a part of that society or culture.\\n(In Hindi the term pardesi might be used to describe such a person and in Persian, ajnabi.\\n)A city-dweller, therefore, might have regarded a forest-dweller as a foreigner, but two peasants living in the same village were not foreigners to each other, even though foreigners may have had different religious or caste backgrounds.\\nHistorians use different types of sources to learn about the past depending upon the period of Historians study and the nature of Historians investigation.\\nThey still rely upon coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information.\\nBut there is also considerable discontinuity.\\nThe number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period.\\nThe number and variety of textual records slowly displaced other types of available information.\\nThrough this period paper gradually became cheaper and morewidely available.\\nPeople used this period paper to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes.\\nManuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples.\\nwealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples were placed in libraries and archives.\\nThese manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but historians are also difficult to use.\\nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand.\\nManuscript copying is somewhat similar.\\nAs scribes copied manuscripts, scribes copied manuscripts also introduced small changes  a word here, a sentence there.\\nThese small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of thesame text became substantially different from one another.\\nThis is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today.\\nwe are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes.\\nAs a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written.\\nOn occasion authors revised authors chronicles at different times.\\nThe fourteenth century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later.\\nThe two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until 1971.\\nIt remained lost in large library collections.\\nThe study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the scale and variety of developments that occurred over the period.\\nAt different moments in the period new technologies made their appearance  like the Persianwheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat.\\nNew foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent: potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee.\\nRemember that all these innovations new technologies and crops came along with people, who brought other ideas with all these innovations new technologies and crops as well.\\nAs a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes.\\nGroups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity.\\nthe subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune.\\nOne group of people who became important in the period were the Rajputs, a name derived from â€œRajaputraâ€\\x9d, the son of a ruler.\\nBetween the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a body of warriorswho claimed Kshatriya caste status.\\nthe term included not just rulers and chieftainsbut also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent.\\nA chivalric code of conduct  extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by Rajputs poets and bards.\\nOther groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important.\\nThroughout the period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others.\\nChanges in Changes in Changes in Changes in their habitat habitat habitat habitat forced many forest dwellers to migrate.\\nOthers started tilling the land and became peasants.\\nOther groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples.\\nOther groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) became part of large complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords.\\nAs a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants.\\nSome possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season.\\nAs society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of people backgrounds and people occupations.\\nRanks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati.\\nThe status of the same jati could vary from area to area.\\nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members.\\ntheir own rules and regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat.\\nBut jatis were also required to follow the rules of jatis villages.\\nSeveral villages were governed by a chieftain.\\nTogether Several villages were only one small unit of a state.\\nLarge states like those of the Cholas , Tughluqs or Mughals encompassed many regions.\\nA Sanskrit praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-87) explained that A Sanskrit praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-87) was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida).\\nPeople of different regions  Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat apparently fled before his armies.\\nHistorians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests.\\nAt the same time, Historians try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent.\\nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and 700 many regions own language and cultural characteristics.\\n700 many regions were also associated with specific ruling dynasties.\\nThere was considerable conflict between these states.\\nOccasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional â€“ spanning diverse regions.\\nNot all these empires were equally stable or successful.\\nWhat was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties?When the Mughal Empire declined in the early sixteenth century, the Mughal Empire led to the re-emergence of regional states.\\nBut years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions.\\nAcross most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that ruled over the regions.\\nThis was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language.\\nThrough the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation.\\nthe character of the different regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing the character of the different regions distinctiveness.\\nThe thousand years of history that we are exploring witnessed major developments in religious traditions.\\nPeopleâ€™s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply personal, but more usually Peopleâ€™s belief in the divine was collective.\\nCollective belief in a supernatural agency religion was often closely connected with the social and economic organisation of local communities.\\nAs the social worlds of these groups altered so too did these groups beliefs.\\nIt was during this period that important changes occurred in what we call Hinduism today.\\nThese included the worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty and the growing importance of Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society.\\nThese knowledge of Sanskrit texts earned the Brahmanas a lot of respect in society.\\nThese dominant position was consolidated by the support of These patrons new rulers searching for prestige.\\nOne of the major developments was the emergence of the idea of bhakti of a loving, personal deity that devotees could reach without the aid of priests or elaborate rituals.\\nMerchants and migrants first brought the teachings of the holy Quran to India in the seventh century.\\nMuslims regard the Quran as Muslims holy book and accept the sovereignty of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and beauty embrace all those who believe in the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and beauty embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard to social background.\\nMany rulers were patrons of Islam and the ulama  learned theologians and jurists.\\nAnd like Hinduism, Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways by Islam followers.\\nThere were the Shia Muslims who believed that the Prophetâ€™s son-in-law, Ali, was the legitimate leader of the Muslim community and the Sunni Muslims who accepted the authority of the early leaders (khalifas) of the Muslim community, and the succeeding Khalifas.\\nThere were other important differences between the various schools of law (Hanafi and Shafiâ€™i mainly in India), and in theology and mystic traditions.\\nHistorians do not see time just as a passing of hours, days or years as a clock or a calendar.\\nTime also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs.\\nThe study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments  periods that possess shared characteristics.\\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: â€œHinduâ€\\x9d, â€œMuslimâ€\\x9d and â€œBritishâ€\\x9d.\\nThis division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments in the economy, society or culture.\\nSuch a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent.\\nFew historians follow this periodisation today.\\nMost look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past.\\nAfter all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh.\\nTherefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without one historical unit problems.\\nMoreover, the â€œmedievalâ€\\x9d period is often contrasted with the â€œmodernâ€\\x9d period.\\nâ€œModernityâ€\\x9d carries with Modernityâ€\\x9d a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement.\\nThis seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever.\\nBut of course we know this was not the case.\\nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies.\\nExisting kings often acknowledged Existing kings as Existing kings subordinates or samantas.\\nExisting kings wereexpected to bring gifts for Existing kings kings or overlords, be present at Existing kings courts and provide Existing kings with military support.\\nAs samantas gained power and wealth, Existing kings declared Existing kings to be maha samanta, maha mandaleshvara (the great lord of a â€œcircleâ€\\x9d or region) and so on.\\nSometimes Existing kings asserted Existing kings independence from Existing kings overlords.\\nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan.\\nInitially Existing kings were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka.\\nIn the mid eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief,overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya garbha (literally, the golden womb).\\nWhen this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, this ritual was thought to lead to the â€œrebirthâ€\\x9d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth.\\nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used men from enterprising families military skills to carve out kingdoms.\\nFor instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara Pratihara Harichandra traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively.\\nMany of these new kings adopted high-sounding titles such as maharaja adhiraja (great king, overlord of kings), tribhuvana chakravartin (lord of the three worlds) and so on.\\nHowever, in spite of such claims,such claims often shared power with such claims samantas as well as with associations of peasants, traders and Brahmanas.\\nIn each of these states, resources were obtained from the producers, that is, peasants, cattle keepers, artisans, who were often persuaded or compelled to surrender part of what these produced.\\nSometimes these were claimed as â€œrentâ€\\x9d due to a lord who asserted that he owned the land.\\nRevenue was also collected from traders.\\nThese resources were used to finance the kingâ€™s establishment, as well as for the construction of temples and forts.\\nThese resources were also used to fight wars, which were in turn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the form of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes.\\nThe functionaries for collecting revenue were generally recruited from influential families, and positions were often hereditary.\\nThis was true about the army as well.\\nIn many cases, close relatives of the king held these positions.\\nPrashastis contain details that may not be literally true.\\nBut they tell us how rulers wanted to depict themselvesas valiant, victorious warriors, for example.\\nThese were composed by learned Brahmanas, who occasionally helped in the administration.\\nKings often rewarded Brahmanas by grants of land.\\nThese were recorded on copper plates, which were given to those who received the land.\\nUnusual for the twelfth century was a long Sanskrit poem containing the history of kings who ruled over Kashmir.\\nIt was composed by an author named Kalhana.\\nan author named Kalhana used a variety of sources, including inscriptions, documents, eyewitness accounts and earlier histories, to write an author named Kalhana account.\\nAt the same time, they tried to control other areas.\\nOne particularly prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga valley.\\nFor centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over Kanauj.\\nBecause there were three â€œpartiesâ€\\x9d in this long-drawn conflict, historians often describe it as the â€œtripartite struggleâ€\\x9d.\\nAs we will see, rulers also tried to demonstrate rulers power and resources by building large temples.\\nSo, when rulers attacked one anotherâ€™s kingdoms, ™s kingdoms often chose to target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich.\\n™s ruled from 997 to 1030, and extended control over parts of Central Asia, Iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent.\\n™s raided the subcontinent almost every year â€“ ™s targets were wealthy temples, including that of Somnath, Gujarat.\\nMuch of the wealth Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazni.\\nMahmud was interested in finding out more about the people Mahmud conquered, and entrusted a scholar named al-Biruni to write an account of the subcontinent.\\nThis Arabic work, known as the Kitab-al Hind, remains an important source for historians.\\nMahmud consulted Sanskrit scholars to prepare this account.\\nOther kings who engaged in warfare include the Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer.\\nOther kings who engaged in warfare attempted to expand Other kings who engaged in warfare control to the west and the east, where Other kings who engaged in warfare were opposed by the Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar Pradesh.\\nThe best-known Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori the very next year, in 1192.\\nFrom Uraiyur to ThanjavurHow did the Cholas rise to power?\\nA minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta.\\nA minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram.\\nVijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century.\\nHe built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there.\\nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power.\\nThe Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of the kingdom.\\nRajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas.\\nHe also reorganised the administration of the empire.\\nRajarajaâ€™s son Rajendra I continued Rajarajaâ€™s son Rajendra policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions.\\nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikonda-cholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels.\\nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around Chola temples.\\nThese were centres of craft production.\\nTemples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others.\\nThe produce of this landwent to maintain all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near the temple â€“ priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc.\\nIn other words, temples were not only places of worship; temples were the hub ofeconomic, social and cultural life as well.\\nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive.\\nChola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world.\\nWhile most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well.\\nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible throughnew developments in agriculture.\\nNotice that the river Kaveribranches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.\\nseveral small channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on These channels banks.\\nWater from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice.\\nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation.\\nForests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas.\\nIn the delta region embankments had to be built to preventflooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields.\\nIn many areas two crops were grown in a year.\\nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially.\\nA variety of methods were used for irrigation.\\nIn some areas wells were dug.\\nIn other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater.\\nRemember that irrigation works require planning â€“ organising labour and resources, maintaining irrigation works and deciding on how water is to be shared.\\nMost of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities.\\nThe administration of the empireHow was The administration of the empireHow organised?Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture.\\nGroups of such villages formed larger units called nadu.\\nThe village council and Tamil Nadu had several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes.\\nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of Tamil Nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government.\\nThe Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc.\\nas markers of respect, and entrusted markers of respect with important offices of the state at the centre.\\nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya.\\nAs a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India.\\nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders.\\nThe village council and the nadu worked very efficiently.\\nThe village council and the nadu decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples.\\nAssociations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns.\\nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised.\\nthe sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc.\\nNames of those eligible to be members of separate committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf and kept in an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to pick small tickets of palm leaf, one by one for each committee.\\nDelhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer.\\nIt was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre.\\nMany rich Jaina merchants lived in Delhi and constructed severaltemples.\\nCoins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation.\\nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century.\\nThe authors of tawarikh were learned men: secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, who both recounted events and advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule.\\nKeep the following additional details in mind: (1) The authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever in villages.\\n(2) They often wrote They histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards.\\n(3) The authors of tawarikh advised rulers on the need to preserve an â€œidealâ€\\x9d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions.\\nThe authors of tawarikh ideas were not shared by everybody.\\nIn 1236 Sultan Iltutmishâ€™s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan.\\nThe chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, recognised that Minhaj-i was more able and qualified than all Minhaj-i brothers.\\nBut The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler.\\nNor were the nobles happy at Minhaj-i attempts to rule independently.\\nMinhaj-i was removed from the throne in 1240.\\nIn the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons.\\nthe Delhi Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies.\\nControlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult.\\nRebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes.\\nthe state was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultanâ€™s weakness.\\nthe Delhi Sultanate barely survived these challenges.\\nthe Delhi Sultanate expansion occurred during the reigns of Ghiyasuddin Balban, Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq.\\nThe first set of campaigns along the internal frontier of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns.\\nDuring these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and hunter-gatherers and pastoralists expelled from these campaigns forests habitat.\\nThese lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged.\\nNew fortresses and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade.\\nIts expansion occurred along the external frontier of the Delhi Sultanate.\\nMilitary expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq.\\nIn their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals.\\nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluqâ€™s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent.\\nthe armies of the Delhi Sultanate had defeated rival armies and seized cities.\\nthe Delhi Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in The Sultanate realm.\\nBut how complete and effective was the Delhi Sultanate control over such a vast territory?\\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators.\\nRather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian.\\nThey were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom.\\nSince They were totally dependent upon They master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon They.\\nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often The Khaljis and Tughluqs clients, to high political positions.\\nThey were appointed as generals and governors.\\nHowever, this also introduced an element of political instability.\\nSlaves and clients were loyal to Slaves and clients masters and patrons, but not to Slaves and clients heirs.\\nthe Delhi Sultans had the Delhi Sultans own servants.\\nAs a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility.\\nThe patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the â€œlow and base-bornâ€\\x9d to high offices.\\nLike the Delhi Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes.\\nThese lands were called iqta and These lands holder was called iqtadar or muqti.\\nThe duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in military campaigns iqtas.\\nIn exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary.\\ntheir also paid their soldiers from the revenues of their assignments.\\nControl over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if their were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted.\\nThese harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq.\\nAccountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis.\\nCare was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers.\\nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, their forced the landed chieftains â€” the samanta aristocrats â€” and rich landlords to accept their authority.\\nUnder Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under the state own control.\\nThe rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were also forced to pay taxes.\\nThe Sultanâ€™s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts.\\nSome of the old chieftains and landlords served the Delhi Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors.\\nThere were three types of taxes â€“ (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasantâ€™s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses.\\nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultansthe Delhi Sultans.\\nIt was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent.\\nEven in the Gangetic plain there were forested areasthat the Delhi Sultanate forces could not penetrate.\\nLocal chieftains established Local chieftains rule in Local chieftains.\\nSometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq control in their control but only for a short duration.\\nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced The Mongols under Genghis Khan under Genghis Khan onslaught soon after.\\nMongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluqâ€™s rule.\\nThis forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge.\\nLet us see how the Delhi Sultans the Delhi Sultans dealt with This.\\nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluqâ€™s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Delhi Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory.\\nUnlike Alauddinâ€™s defensive measures, Muhammad measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against The Mongols under Genghis Khan.\\nAfter the Tughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from Delhi and Agra until 1526.\\nBy then, Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the entire south India had independent rulers who established flourishing states and prosperous capitals.\\nThis was also the period which saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the Afghans and the Rajputs.\\nSome of the states established in this period were small but powerful and extremely well administered.\\nSher Shah Sur (1540-1545) started Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545) career as the manager of a small territory for Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545) uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun (1530-1540, 1555-1556).\\nSher Shah Sur (1540-1545) captured Delhi and established Sher Shah own dynasty.\\nAlthough Sher Shah own dynasty ruled for only fifteen years (1540-1555), Sher Shah own dynasty introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin Khalji and made Sher Shah own dynasty more efficient.\\nSher Shahâ€™s administration became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar (1556-1605) when Sher Shahâ€™s administration consolidated the Mughal Empire.\\nRuling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent with such a diversity of people and cultures was an extremely difficult task for any ruler to accomplishin the Middle Ages.\\nQuite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time.\\nFrom the latter half of the sixteenth century their expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi until in the seventeenth century their controlled nearly all of the subcontinent.\\ntheir imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore.\\nToday the Prime Minister of India addresses India from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors, on Independence Day.\\nthe Mughals were descendants of two great lineages of rulers.\\nFrom the Mughals motherâ€™s side the Mughals were descendants of Genghis Khan (died 1227), ruler of the Mongol tribes, China and Central Asia.\\nFrom their fatherâ€™s side their were the successors of Timur (died 1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and modern-day Turkey.\\nHowever, the Mughals did not like to be called Mughal or Mongol.\\nThis was because The Mongols under Genghis Khan™s memory was associated with the massacre of innumerable people.\\nmemory was also linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol competitors.\\nOn the other hand, the Mughals wereproud of their Timurid ancestry, not least of all because their great ancestor had captured Delhi in 1398.\\ntheir celebrated their genealogy pictorially, each ruler getting a picture made of Timur and each ruler.\\nBabur, the first Mughal emperor (1526-1530), succeeded to the throne of Ferghana in 1494 when each ruler was only 12 years old.\\neach ruler was forced to leave each ruler ancestral throne due to the invasion of another Mongol group, the Uzbegs.\\nAfter years of wandering each ruler seized Kabul in 1504.\\nIn 1526 each ruler defeated the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, at Panipat and captured Delhi and AgraAgra.\\nthe Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited the eldest son fatherâ€™s estate.\\nInstead they followed the Mughal and Timurid custom of coparcenary inheritance, or a division of the inheritance amongst all the sons.\\nthe two rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept The Mughal rulers authority.\\nBut as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined powerful many other rulers voluntarily.\\nthe Rajputs are a good example of this.\\nMany of the Rajputs married the Rajputs daughters into Mughal families and received high positions.\\nBut many resisted as well.\\nthe Rajputs refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time.\\nOnce defeated, however, the Rajputs were honourably treated by the Mughals, given the Rajputs lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir).\\nThe careful balance between defeating but not humiliating the Rajputs opponents enabled the Mughals to extend the Rajputs influence over many kings and chieftains.\\nBut it was difficult to keep this balance all the time.\\nWhat was the consequence of this insult?\\nAs the empire expanded to encompass different regions the Mughals the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people.\\nFrom a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups.\\nThose who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars.\\nThe term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank.\\nThe term mansabdar was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank,salary and (3) military responsibilities.\\nRank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat.\\nThe higher the zat, the more prestigious was the nobleâ€™s position in court and the larger his salary.\\nThe mansabdarâ€™s military responsibilities required The mansabdar to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen.\\nThe mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got his cavalrymen registered, his cavalrymen horses branded and then received money to pay his cavalrymen horses horses as salary.\\nMansabdars received Mansabdars salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas.\\nBut unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs.\\ntheir only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for their by They servants while Mansabdars served in some other part of the country.\\nIn Akbarâ€™s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that these jagirs revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansadar.\\nBy Aurangzebâ€™s reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenuecollected was often less than the granted sum.\\nThere was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars which meant a long wait before they received a jagir.\\nThese and other factors created a shortage in the number of jagirs.\\nAs a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while many jagirdars had a jagir.\\nAurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of Aurangzeb reign and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously.\\nThe main source of income available to Mughal rulers was tax on the produce of the peasantry.\\nIn most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain.\\nthe Mughals used one term  zamindars  to describe all intermediaries, whether all intermediaries were local headmenof villages or powerful chieftains.\\nAkbarâ€™s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a ten year period, 1570-1580.\\nOn the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash.\\nEach province was divided into revenue circles with Each province own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops.\\nThis revenue system was known as zabt.\\nThis revenue system was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the landand keep very careful accounts.\\nThis was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal.\\nIn some areas zamindars   exercised a great deal of power.\\nThe exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive The exploitation by Mughal administrators to rebellion.\\nSometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority.\\nThese peasant revolts challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the seventeenth century.\\nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in Akbar book the Akbar Nama, in particular in Akbar book the Akbar Nama last volume, the Ain-i Akbari.\\nAbul Fazl in Akbar explained that the Mughal Empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions.\\nEach province also had a financial officer or diwan.\\nFor the maintenance of peace and order in Each province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal).\\nAkbarâ€™s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue.\\nWhile nobles were loyal the Mughal Empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of many nobles own.\\nmany nobles loyalties to the empire were weakened by many nobles own self-interest.\\nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s Akbar started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians.\\ndiscussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians took place in the ibadat khana.\\nAkbar was interested in the religion and social customs of different people.\\nIt made Akbar realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots.\\nreligious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst disharmony subjects.\\nThis eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or universal peace.\\nThis idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in This idea of tolerance realm.\\nInstead This idea of tolerance focused on a system of ethics honesty, justice, peace  that was universally applicable.\\nAbul Fazl in Akbar helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i-kul.\\nThis principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well.\\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity.\\nInternational travellers described The administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire as the fabled land of wealth.\\nBut these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence.\\nThe inequalities were glaring.\\nDocuments from the twentieth year of Shah Jahanâ€™s reign inform us that the highest ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000.\\nThis small number a mere 5.\\n6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars  received 61.\\n5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for the total estimated revenue of the empire and the total estimated revenue of the empire troopers.\\nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of The Mughal emperors and The Mughal emperors and their mansabdars mansabdars income on salaries and goods.\\nThis expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied The Mughal emperors and their mansabdars with goods and produce.\\nBut the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers the peasant and the artisan.\\nThe poorest amongst the primary producers lived from hand to mouth and the primary producers could hardly consider investing in additional resources tools and supplies  to increase productivity.\\nThe wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world.\\nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made The enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century.\\nAs the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, the Mughal emperor servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions.\\nthe Mughal emperor servants constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh.\\nAlthough the Mughal emperor servants continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as the Mughal emperor servants master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated the Mughal emperor servants independent political identities.\\nQutbuddin Aybak had this constructed around 1199.\\nNotice the pattern created under the balcony by the small arches and geometrical designs.\\nthe pattern created under the balcony by the small arches and geometrical designs are in Arabic.\\nNotice that the surface of the minar is curved and angular.\\nPlacing an inscription on such a surface required great precision.\\nOnly the most skilled craftsperson could perform this task.\\nRemember that very few buildings were made of stone or brick 800 years ago.\\nWhat would have been the impact of a building like the Qutb Minar on observersin the thirteenth century?\\nBetween the eighth and the eighteenth centuries kings and their officers built two kinds of structures:the first were forts, palaces and tombs â€“ safe, protected and grandiose places of rest in this economic world and the next; the second were structures meant for public activity including temples, mosques, tanks, wells, caravan serais and bazaars.\\nKings were expected to care for Kings subjects, and by making structures for Kings use and comfort, rulers hoped to win rulers praise.\\nConstruction activity was also carried out by others, including merchants.\\nothers, including merchants built temples, mosques and wells.\\nHowever, domestic architecture â€“ large mansions (havelis) of merchants â€“ has survived only from the eighteenth century.\\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologies used for construction.\\nTake something like a roof for example.\\nWe can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls.\\nBut the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure.\\nThis requires more sophisticated skills.\\nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings.\\nRoofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called trabeate or corbelled.\\nBetween the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis).\\nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century: (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called arcuate.(2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction.\\nThis was very high quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete.\\nThis made construction of large structures easier and faster.\\nTemples and mosques were beautifully constructed because Temples and mosques were places of worship.\\nTemples and mosques were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron.\\nTake the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple.\\nAn inscription mentions that An inscription was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of King Rajarajadeva god, Rajarajeshvaram.\\nNotice how the name of the ruler and the god are very similar.\\nKing Rajarajadeva took the godâ€™s name because the god was auspicious and King Rajarajadeva wanted to appear like a god.\\nThrough the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram).\\nTemples and mosques were all constructed by kings.\\nThe other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler.\\nthe temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies.\\nAs his allies worshipped his allies deities together in Temples and mosques, it seemed as if his allies brought the just rule of the gods on earth.\\nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of God but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the Shadow of God.\\nAn inscription in the Delhi mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because a king had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great law-givers of the past.\\nThe greatest law-giver and architect was God.\\nThe greatest law-giver and architect created this economic world out of chaos andintroduced order and symmetry.\\nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise kings moral right to be rulers.\\nConstructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim rulers close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change.\\nRulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform Rulers capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to Rulers rule and Rulers realm.\\nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain.\\nAt the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised.\\nSultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i kuhna.\\nIt was called the hauz-i Sultani or the Kingâ€™s Reservoir.\\nRulers often constructed tanks andreservoirs â€“ big and small â€“ for use by ordinary people.\\nSometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the jami masjid) or a gurudwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs).\\nBecause kings built temples to demonstrate kings devotion to God and kings power and wealth, it is not surprising that when kings attacked one anotherâ€™s kingdoms, kings often targeted these buildings.\\nIn the early ninth century when the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and defeated the king, Sena I (831-851), the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti noted: the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti chronicler Dhammakitti removed all the valuables.\\nThe statue of the Buddha made entirely of gold in the Jewel Palace and the golden images in the various monasteries â€“ all these the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti seized.\\nThe blow to the pride of the ruler had to be avenged and the next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, ordered the Sinhalese ruler general to invade Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas.\\nThe Buddhist chronicler noted that the expedition made a special effort to find and restore the gold statue of the Buddha.\\nSimilarly in the early eleventh century, when King Rajarajadeva built a Shiva temple in King Rajarajadeva King Rajarajadeva I capital King Rajarajadeva I filled a Shiva temple with prized statues seized from defeated rulers.\\nAn incomplete list included: a Sun-pedestal from the Chalukyas, a Ganesha statue and several statues of Durga; a Nandi statue from the eastern Chalukyas; an image of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and Bhairavi from the Kalingas of Orissa; and a Kali statue from the Palas of Bengal.\\nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a contemporary of King RajarajadevaDuring Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni campaigns in the subcontinent Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni also attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted the temples of defeated kings.\\nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni was not a very important ruler at that time.\\nBut by destroying temples â€“ especially the one at Somnath â€“ Somnath â€“ tried to win credit as a great hero of Islam.\\nIn the political culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed most rulers political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers.\\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex.\\nBabur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture.\\nIn Shah Jahan autobiography, Babur described Shah Jahan interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels.\\nformal gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of These gardens symmetrical division into quarters.\\nBeginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi.\\nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbarâ€™s reign.\\nFor inspiration, Akbarâ€™s architects turned to the tombs of Akbarâ€™s Central Asianancestor, Timur.\\nThe central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayunâ€™s tomb.\\nThe central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) was placed in the centre of a huge formal chaharbagh and built in the tradition known as â€œeight paradisesâ€\\x9d or hasht bihisht â€“ a central hall surrounded by eight rooms.\\nThe building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble.\\nThe building was during Shah Jahanâ€™s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis.\\n™s reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi.\\nThe ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas or am) were carefully planned.\\nThese courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls, placed within a large courtyard.\\nShah Jahanâ€™s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque.\\nThe pedestal on which Jahanâ€™s throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session.\\nThe idea of King Rajarajadeva as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features.\\nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah in Shah Jahan newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi.\\nBehind his throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted God Orpheus playing the lute.\\nIt was believed that Orpheusâ€™s music could calm ferocious beasts until they resided together peaceably.\\nThe construction of Shah Jahanâ€™s audience hall aimed to communicate that the kingâ€™s justice would treat the high and the low as equals where all could live together in harmony.\\nIn the early years of His reign, Shah™s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed the nobility homes on the banks of the River Yamuna.\\nThese were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format.\\nThe chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the river-front garden.\\nIn this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at the chahar bagh edge, close to the bank of the River Yamuna.\\nShah adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of Shah reign.\\nHere the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the River Yamuna and The chahar bagh garden was to the white marble mausoleum.\\nShah Jahandeveloped this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the River Yamuna.\\nIn the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front.\\nOnly specially favoured nobles â€“ like his eldest son Dara Shukoh â€“ were given access to the River Yamuna.\\nAll others had to construct All others homes in the new city of Shahjahanabad away from the River Yamuna.\\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another.\\nIn Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers werestrongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golcunda.\\nIn Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri.\\nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under different regions rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles.\\nMughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of Mughal rulers own buildings.\\nIn Bengal, for example, Mughal rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut.\\nthe Mughals liked this â€œBangla domeâ€\\x9d so much that the Mughals used this â€œBangla domeâ€\\x9d in The Mughals architecture.\\nThe impact of other regions was also evident.\\nIn Akbarâ€™s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings bear the impact of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa.\\nEven though the authority of Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under the Mughal rulers patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever other rulers tried to establishWhat would a traveller visiting a medieval town expect to find?This would depend on what kind of a town This was â€“ a temple town, an administrativecentre, a commercial town or a port town to name just some possibilities.\\nLetâ€™s travel in our imagination to Thanjavur, the capital of the Cholas, as it was a thousand years ago.\\nthe River Yamuna Kaveri flows near this beautiful town.\\nOne hears the bells of the Rajarajeshvara temple built by King Rajaraja Chola.\\nThe townspeople are all praise for its architect Kunjaramallan Rajaraja Perunthachchan who has proudly carved his name on the temple wall.\\nInside is a massive Shiva linga.\\nBesides a Shiva temple, there are palaces with mandapas or pavilions.\\nKings hold court in these mandapas, issuing orders to Kings subordinates.\\nThere are also barracks for the army.\\nthis beautiful town is bustling with markets selling grain, spices, cloth and jewellery.\\nWater supply for this beautiful town comes from wells and tanks.\\nThe Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of Uraiyur are busy producing cloth for flags to be used in the temple festival, fine cottons for the king and nobility and coarse cotton for the masses.\\nSome distance away at Svamimalai, the sthapatis or sculptors are making exquisite bronze idols and tall, ornamental bell metal lamps.\\nThanjavur is also an example of a temple town.\\nTemple towns r epresent a very important patter n of urbanisation, the process by which cities develop.\\nTemples were often central to the economy and society.\\nMughal rulers built temples to demonstrate Rulers devotion to various deities.\\nMughal rulers also endowed temples with grants of land and money to carry out elaborate rituals, feed pilgrims and priests and celebrate festivals.\\nPilgrims who flocked to the temples also made donations.\\nTemple authorities used Temple authorities wealth to finance trade and banking.\\nGradually a large number of priests, workers, artisans, traders, etc.\\nsettled near a Shiva temple to cater to the temple needs and those of the pilgrims.\\nThus grew temple towns.\\nTowns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat.\\nOther important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.\\nPilgrimage centres also slowly developed into townships.\\nVrindavan (Uttar Pradesh) and Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) are examples of two such towns.\\nAjmer (Rajasthan) was the capital of the Chauhan kings in the twelfth century and later became the suba headquarters under the Mughals.\\nAjmer (Rajasthan) provides an excellent example of religious coexistence.\\nKhwaja Muinuddin Chishti, thecelebrated Sufi saint who settled there in the twelfth century, attracted devotees from all creeds.\\nAjmer (Rajasthan) is a lake, Pushkar, which has attracted pilgrims from ancient times.\\nFrom the eighth century onwards the subcontinent was dotted with several small towns.\\nThese probably emerged from large villages.\\nThese usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought These produce to sell.\\nThese also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops.\\nBesides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc.\\nWhile some traders lived in this beautiful town, others travelled from town to town.\\nMany came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper.\\nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns.\\na zamindar levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes â€œdonatedâ€\\x9d the â€œrightâ€\\x9d to collect taxes to local temples, which had been built by taxes or by rich merchants.\\nThese â€œrightsâ€\\x9d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day.\\nThere were many kinds of traders.\\nmany kinds of traders included the Banjaras.\\nSeveral traders, especially horse traders, formed associations, with headmen who negotiated on Several traders, especially horse traders behalf with warriors who bought horses.\\nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, traders usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect traders interests.\\nThere were several such guilds in south India from the eighth century onwards â€“ the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi.\\nseveral such guilds in south India from the eighth century traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China.\\nThere were also communities like the Chettiars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the principal trading groups of China.\\nGujarati traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast Asia and ChinaChina.\\nEast Africa, Southeast Asia and China sold textiles and spices in these ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and ChinaChina.\\nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders.\\nIndian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching very high profits.\\nSpices grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried ginger, etc.)became an important part of European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive.\\nThis eventually drew European traders to India.\\nWe will shortly read about how this changed the face of trading and towns.\\nThe craftspersons of Bidar were so famed for The craftspersons of Bidar inlay work in copper and silver that it came to be called Bidri.\\nThe Panchalas or Vishwakarma community, consisting of goldsmiths, bronzesmiths, blacksmiths, masons and carpenters, were essential to the building of temples.\\nThe Panchalas or Vishwakarma community, consisting of goldsmiths, bronzesmiths, blacksmiths, masons and carpenters also played an important role in the construction of palaces, big buildings, tanks and reservoirs.\\nSimilarly, weavers such as the Saliyar or Kaikkolars emerged as prosperous communities, making donations to temples.\\nSome aspects of cloth making like cotton cleaning, spinning and dyeing became specialised and independent crafts.\\nHampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336.\\nThe magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city.\\nNo mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge No mortar or cementing agent together by interlocking.\\nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive.\\nThe buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures.\\nThe buildings in the royal complex also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels.\\nIn its heyday in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities.\\nMoors (a name used collectively for Muslim merchants), Chettis and agents of European traders such as thePortuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi.\\nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple.\\nThe Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi.\\nArchaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs.\\nFrom here the king also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts.\\nHampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans â€“ the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar.\\nSurat in Gujarat was the emporium of western trade during the Mughal period along with Cambay (present-day Khambat) and somewhat later, Ahmedabad.\\nSurat was the gateway for trade with West Asia via the Gulf of Ormuz.\\nSurat has also been called the gate to Mecca because many pilgrim ships set sail from here.\\nSurat was cosmopolitan and people of all castes and creeds lived there.\\nIn the eighth century the Portuguese, Dutch and English had the Portuguese, Dutch and English factories and warehouses at Surat.\\nAccording to the English chronicler Ovington who wrote an account of the port in 1689, on average a hundred ships of different countries could be found anchored at the port at any given time.\\nThere were also several retail and wholesale shops selling cotton textiles.\\ncotton textiles were famous for cotton textiles and had a market in West Asia, Africa and Europe.\\nSurat built numerous rest-houses to take care of the needs of people from all over the world who came to Surat.\\nThere were magnificent buildings and innumerable pleasure parks.\\nThe Kathiawad seths or mahajans (moneychangers) had huge banking houses at Surat.\\nIt is noteworthy that the Surat hundis were honoured in the far-off markets of Cairo in Egypt, Basra in Iraq and Antwerp in Belgium.\\nHowever, Surat began to decline towards the end of the seventeenth century.\\nThis was because of many factors: the loss of markets and productivity becauseof the decline of the Mughal Empire, control of the sea routes by the Portuguese and competition from Bombay (present-day Mumbai) where the English East India Company shifted the English East India Company headquarters in 1668.\\nToday, Surat is a bustling commercial centre.\\nThe town of Masulipatnam or Machlipatnam (literally, fish port town) lay on the delta of the Krishna river.\\nIn the eighth century it was a centre of intense activity.\\nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as Masulipatnam became the most important port on the Andhra coast.\\nThe fort at Masulipatnam was built by Dutch.\\nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies.\\nFiercecompetition among various trading groups â€“ the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders â€“ made Surat populous and prosperous.\\nAs the Mughals began to extend the Mughals power to Golconda the Mughals representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other.\\nIn 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda.\\nThis caused the various East India Companies to look for alternatives.\\nThis was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland.\\nThe new Company trade centres, The new Company trade centres was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles.\\nAs the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both Masulipatnam merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town.\\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, European countries were searching for spices and textiles, which had become popular European countries in Europe and West Asia.\\nThe English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand The English, Dutch and French commercial activities in the east.\\nInitially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships.\\nHowever, the various East India Companies used the European Companies naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as the European Companies agents.\\nUltimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent.\\nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc.\\nwith more and more peopletaking them up.\\nIndian textile designs became increasingly refined.\\nHowever, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons.\\nthem now began to work on a system of advances which meant that them had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents.\\nWeavers no longer had the liberty of selling Weavers own cloth or weaving Weavers own patterns.\\nWeavers had to reproduce the designs supplied to Weavers by the Company agents.\\nthe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today.\\nCrafts and commerce underwent major changes as merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved into the Black Towns established by the various East India Companies within these new cities.\\nThe â€œblacksâ€\\x9d or native traders and craftspersons were confined here while The Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda occupied the superior residencies of Fort St George in Madras or Fort St William in Calcutta.\\nEven as this was happening, new arts, crafts and production activities flourished in towns  and  villages.\\nOver  the  centuries  important political,  social  and  economic  developments  hadtaken place.\\nBut social change was not the same everywhere, because different kinds of societies evolved differently.\\nIt is important to understand how, and why, this happened.\\nIn large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna.\\nthe rules of varna, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms.\\nThe difference between the high and low, and between the rich and poor, increased.\\nUnder the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further.\\nThere were, however, other kinds of societies as well.\\nMany societies in the subcontinent did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas.\\nNor were Many societies in the subcontinent divided into numerous unequal classes.\\nSuch societies are often called tribes.\\nMembers of each tribe were united by kinship bonds.\\nMany tribes obtained Many tribes livelihood from agriculture.\\nOthers were hunter-gatherers or herders.\\nMost often Others combined these activities to make full use of the natural resources of the area in which Others lived.\\nSome tribes were nomadic and moved from one place to another.\\nA tribal group controlled land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst households according to A tribal group own rules.\\nMany large tribes thrived in different parts of the subcontinent.\\nMany large tribes usually lived in forests, hills, deserts and places difficult to reach.\\nSometimes Many large tribes clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies.\\nIn various ways, Many large tribes retained the tribes freedom and preserved Many large tribes separate culture.\\nBut the caste-based and tribal societies also depended on each other for the caste-based and tribal societies diverse needs.\\nThis relationship, of conflict and dependence, gradually caused the caste-based and tribal societies to change.\\nContemporary historians and travellers give very scanty information about tribes.\\nA few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records.\\nBut tribal people preserved rich customs and oral traditions.\\ntribal people were passed down to each new generation.\\nPresent-day historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories.\\nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent.\\nThe area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time.\\nSome powerful tribes controlled large territories.\\nIn Punjab, each tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\\nLater, the Gakkhars became more important.\\nSome powerful tribes chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar.\\nIn Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before the Langahs and Arghuns were subdued by the Mughals.\\nThe Balochis were another large and powerfultribe in the north-west.\\nThe Balochis were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs.\\nIn the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis.\\nThe distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes â€“ the Nagas, Ahoms and many others.\\nIn many areas of pr esent - day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century.\\nRaja Man Singh, Akbarâ€™s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591.\\nA large amount of booty was taken from booty, but booty were not entirely subdued.\\nUnder Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated each tribe.\\nThe Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal.\\nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others.\\nKolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat.\\nFurther south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others.\\neach tribe was spread across western and central India.\\nBy the late sixteenth century, many of each tribe had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars.\\nMany Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained hunter - gatherers.\\nThe Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.\\nNomadic pastoralists moved over long distances with Nomadic pastoralists animals.\\nNomadic pastoralists lived on milk and other pastoral products .\\nNomadic pastoralists also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products.\\nNomadic pastoralists bought and sold these goods as Nomadic pastoralists moved from one place to another, transporting Nomadic pastoralists on Nomadic pastoralists animals.\\nThe Gonds were the most important trader - nomads.\\nThe Gonds caravan was called tanda.\\nSultan Alauddin Khalji used The Gonds to transport grain to the city markets.\\nEmperor Jahangir wrote in Emperor Jahangir memoirs that The Gonds carried grain on the Banjaras bullocks from different areas and sold The Gonds in towns.\\nthe Banjaras carried grain on the Banjaras bullocks from different areas and sold the Banjaras in towns transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns.\\nWith a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain.\\nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people.\\nDifferent castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village.\\nDifferent castes of petty pedlarsmade  and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks.\\nSometimes mendicants  acted  aswandering merchants .\\nThere were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for different towns and villages livelihood livelihood.\\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required.\\nSmaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas.\\nFor example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas.\\nOn the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis.\\nSpecialised artisans â€“ smiths, carpenters and masons were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas.\\nJatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society.\\nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\\nnew Rajput clans belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others.\\nSome of these, too, had been tribes earlier.\\nMany of new Rajput clans came to be regarded as Rajputs.\\nRajputs gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas.\\nHere a developed society was emerging, and rulers used rulers wealth to create powerful states.\\nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow.\\nGradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system.\\nBut only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class.\\nA large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society.\\nOn the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early.\\nmany dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier continued to reject the caste system.\\nThe unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism.\\nThe emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people.\\nTwo examples of this important part of our history are described below.\\nThe Gonds The Gonds lived in a vast forested region called Gondwana or country inhabited by The Gonds.\\nThe Gonds practised shifting cultivation.\\nThe large Gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans.\\nEach clan had Each clan own raja or rai.\\nAbout the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs.\\nThe Akbar Nama, a history of Akbarâ€™s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages.\\nThe administrative system of a few large Gond kingdoms was becoming centralised.\\nthe Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages was divided into garhs.\\nEach garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan.\\nThis was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi.\\nThe chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each.\\nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society.\\nTheir basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes.\\nBrahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential.\\nThe Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs.\\nSo, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah.\\nHis son, Dalpat, married princessDurgawati,  the  daughter  ofSalbahan,  the  ChandelRajput raja of Mahoba.\\nDalpat, however, died early.\\nRani  Durgawatiwas  very  capable,  andstarted ruling on behalfof her five-year-old son,Bir Narain.\\nUnder her, thekingdom  became  evenmore extensive.\\nIn 1565,the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga.\\nA strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati.\\nRani Durgawati was defeated  and  preferred to die rather than surrender.\\nRani Durgawati son, too,died fighting soon after.\\nGarha Katanga was a rich state.\\nGarha Katanga earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms.\\nWhen the Mughals defeated The Gonds, the Mughals captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants.\\nthe Mughals annexed part of the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain.\\nDespite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time.\\nHowever, the Gond kingdoms became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas.\\nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century.\\nthe Gond kingdoms created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords).\\nDuring the sixteenth century, the Gond kingdoms annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes.\\nThe Ahoms built a large state, and for this The Ahoms used firearms as early as the 1530s.\\nBy the 1660s the Gond kingdoms could even make high-quality gunpowder and cannons.\\nHowever, The Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west.\\nIn 1662, theMughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom.\\nDespite their brave defence, The Ahoms were defeated.\\nBut direct Mughal control over this region could not last long.\\nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour.\\nThose forced to work for The Ahom state were called paiks.\\nA census of the population was taken.\\nEach village had to send a number of paiks by rotation.\\nPeople from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places.\\nAhom clans were thus broken up.\\nBy the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised.\\nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war.\\nAt other times, other times were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works.\\nThe Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation.\\nAhom society was divided into clans or khels.\\nThere were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms.\\nA khel often controlled several villages.\\nThe peasant was given land by The peasant village community.\\nEven the king could not take it away without the communityâ€™s consent.\\nOriginally, The Ahoms worshipped The Ahoms own tribal gods.\\nDuring the first half of the seventeenth centurythe seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased.\\nTemples and Brahmanas were granted land by Even the king.\\nIn the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion.\\nBut the Ahom kings did not completely give up the Ahom kings traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism.\\nAhom society was very sophisticated.\\nPoets and scholars were given land grants.\\nTheatre was encouraged.\\nImportant works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language.\\nHistorical works, known as buranjis, were also written â€“ first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese.\\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining.\\nVarna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other.\\nThis interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change.\\nThere were many different tribes and many different tribes took up diverse livelihoods.\\nOver a period of time, many of many different tribes merged with caste-based society.\\nOthers, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism.\\nSome tribes establishedextensive states with well-organised systems of administration.\\nSome tribes establishedextensive states with well-organised systems of administration.\\n thus became politically powerful.\\nSuch intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century.\\nBefore large kingdoms emerged, different groups of people worshipped different groups of people own gods and goddesses.\\nAs people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop.\\nThe idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted.\\nSimilarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period.\\nThe belief that social privileges came from birth in a noble family or a â€œhighâ€\\x9d caste was the subject of many learned texts.\\nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort.\\nOthers felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti).\\nThis idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era.\\nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals.\\nAt the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in differ ent areascame to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga.\\nIn the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults.\\nEventually the Puranas also laid down that the Puranas was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of the grace of God caste status.\\nThe idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs.\\nThe seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of new religious movements, led by the Nayanars (saints devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu) who came from all castes including those considered â€œuntouchableâ€\\x9d like the Pulaiyar and the Panars.\\nThey were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the path to salvation.\\nThey drew upon the ideals of love and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended Tamil literature, composed during the early centuries of the Common Era) with the values of bhakti.\\nThe Nayanars and Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages they visited, and set they to music.\\nBetween the tenth and twelfth centuries the Chola and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening the links between the bhakti tradition and temple worship.\\nThis was also the time when their poems were compiled.\\nBesides, hagiographies or religious biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also composed.\\nToday we use these texts as sources for writing histories of the bhakti tradition.\\nShankara, one of the most influential philosophers of India, was born in Kerala in the eighth century.\\nShankara, one of the most influential philosophers of India was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme God which is the Ultimate Reality.\\nShankara, one of the most influential philosophers of India taught that Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless and without any attributes.\\nShankara, one of the most influential philosophers of India considered the world around we to be an illusion or maya, and preached renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of knowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman and attain salvation.\\nRamanuja, born in Tamil Nadu in the eleventh century, was deeply influenced by the Alvars.\\nAccording to Shankara, one of the most influential philosophers of India the best means of attaining salvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu.\\nVishnu in Vishnu in His grace grace helps the devotee to attain the bliss of union with Vishnu in His grace.\\nVishnu in His grace propounded the doctrine of Vishishtadvaita or qualified oneness in that the soul even when united with the Supreme God remained distinct.\\nRamanujaâ€™s doctrine greatly inspired the new strand of bhakti which developed in north India subsequently.\\nwe noted earlier the connection between the Tamil bhakti movement and temple worship.\\nThis in turn led to a reaction that is best represented in the Virashaiva movement initiated by Basavanna and Basavanna companions like Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi.\\nthe Tamil bhakti movement and temple began in Karnataka in the mid-twelfth century.\\nThe Virashaivas argued strongly for the equality of all human beings and against Brahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of women.\\nThey were also against all forms of ritual and idol worship.\\nFrom the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people.\\nThe most important among a great number of saint-poets, whose songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people were Janeshwar, Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakkubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the untouchable Mahar caste.\\nThis regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people.\\nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth.\\nIn fact These saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with These saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth families, earning These saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need.\\nA new humanist idea emerged as These saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth insisted that bhaktilay in sharing othersâ€™ pain.\\nAs the famous Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta said, \"They are Vaishnavas who understand the pain of others\".\\nA number of religious groups that emerged during this period criticised the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments.\\nAmong A number of religious groups that emerged during this period were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and Yogis.\\nA number of religious groups that emerged during this period advocated renunciation of the world.\\nTo A number of religious groups that emerged during this period the path to salvation lay in meditation on the formless Ultimate Reality and the realisation of oneness with it.\\nTo achieve this A number of religious groups that emerged during this period advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation.\\nThese groups became particularly popular among â€œlowâ€\\x9d castes.\\nThese groups criticism of conventional religion created the ground for devotional religion to become a popular force in northern India.\\nThe sants had much in common with the Sufis, so much so that The sants is believed that the Sufis adopted many ideas of each other.\\nthe Sufis were Muslim mystics.\\nthe Sufis rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings.\\nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God.\\nIslam also rejected idol worship and considerably simplified rituals of worship into collective prayers.\\nAt the same time Muslim scholars developed a holy law called Shariat.\\nthe Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars.\\nthe Sufis sought union with God much as a lover seeks a lover belovedwith a disregard for the world.\\nLike the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing the saint-poets feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around the saint-poets.\\nAmong the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi.\\nLike the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way.\\nthe heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc.\\nunder the guidance of a master or pir.\\nThus emerged the silsilas, a genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice.\\nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards.\\nThis process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, when several major Sufi centresdeveloped all over the subcontinent.\\nThe Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders.\\nThe Chishti silsila had along line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga.\\nThe Sufi masters held The Sufi masters assemblies in The Sufi masters khanqahs or hospices.\\nDevotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs .\\nThe Sufi masters discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving The Sufi masters worldly problems , or simply attended the music and dance sessions.\\nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of people illnesses and troubles.\\nThe tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged.\\nThe period after the thirteenth century saw a new wave of the bhakti movement in north India.\\nThis was an age when Islam, Brahmanical Hinduism, Sufism, various strands of bhakti, and the Nathpanths, Siddhas and Yogis influenced one another.\\nWe saw that new towns and kingdoms were emerging, and people were taking up new professions and finding new roles for new professions.\\nSuch people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and labourers, thronged to listen to these new saints and spread Such people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and labourers ideas.\\nSome of Some of Such people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and labourers like Kabir and Baba Guru Nanak like Kabir and Baba Guru Nanak rejected all orthodox religions.\\nOthers like Tulsidas and Surdas accepted existing beliefs and practices but wanted to make these accessible to all.\\nTulsidas conceived of God in the form of Rama.\\nTulsidasâ€™s composition, the Ramcharitmanas, written in Awadhi (a language used in eastern Uttar Pradesh), is important both as anexpression of his devotion and as a literary work.\\nSurdas was an ardent devotee of Krishna.\\nSurdas compositions, compiled in the Sursagara, Surasaravali and Sahitya Lahari, express Surdas devotion.\\nAlso contemporary was Shankaradeva of Assam (late fifteenth century) who emphasised devotion to Vishnu, and composed poems and plays in Assamese.\\nSurdas began the practice of setting up namghars or houses of recitation and prayer, a practice that continues to date.\\nThis regional tradition of bhakti also included saints like Dadu Dayal, Ravidas and Mirabai.\\nMirabai was a Rajput princess married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth century.\\nMirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint from a caste considered untouchable.\\nMirabai wasdevoted to Krishna and composed innumerable bhajans expressing Mirabai intense devotion.\\nMirabai songs also openly challenged the norms of the upper castes and became popular with the masses in Rajasthan and Gujarat.\\nA unique feature of most of the saints is that the saints works were composed in regional languages and could be sung.\\nthe saints works were composed in regional languages and could be sung became immensely popular and were handed down orally from generation to generation.\\nUsually the poorest, most deprived communities and women transmitted Her songs, often adding Her songs own experiences.\\nThus the songs as we have Her songs today are as much a creation of the saints as of generations of people who sang Her songs.\\nHer songs have become a part of our living popular culture.\\nKabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, was one of the most influential saints.\\nHe was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi).\\nWe have little reliable information about He life.\\nWe get to know of He ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by He and sung by wandering bhajan singers.\\nSome of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak.\\nKabirâ€™s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions.\\nteachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system.\\nThe language of teachings poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people.\\nteachings also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow.\\nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion.\\nKabir drew Kabir followers from among both Hindus and Muslims.\\nWe know more about Guru Nanak (1469-1539) than about Kabir.\\nBorn at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), Guru Nanak (1469-1539) travelled widely before establishing a centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi).\\nA regular worship that consisted of the singing of (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi).\\n own hymns was established therefor (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi).\\n followers.\\nIrrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, their former creed, caste or gender followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar).\\nThe sacred space thus created by Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal.\\nThe sacred space thus created by Guru Nanak is now known as Gurdwara.\\nBefore his death in 1539, Guru Nanak appointed one of his as his successor.\\nhis name was Lehna but his came to be known as Guru Angad, signifying that his was a part of Guru Nanak himself.\\nGuru Angad compiled the compositions of Guru Nanak, to which Guru Angad added Guru Angad own ina new script known as Gurmukhi.\\nThe three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of â€œNanakâ€\\x9d and all of The three successors of Guru Angad compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604.\\nTo this compilation were added the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur.\\nIn 1706 this compilation was authenticated by his son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh.\\nhis son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs.\\nThe number of Guru Nanakâ€™s followers increased through the sixteenth century under Guru Nanakâ€™s successors.\\nThe number of Guru Nanakâ€™s followers belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated.\\nThis may have something to do with Guru Nanakâ€™s insistence that Guru Nanakâ€™s followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations.\\nNanakâ€™s followers were also expected to contribute to the general funds of the community of followers.\\nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple).\\nIt was virtually self-governing and modern historians refer to the early seventeenth century Sikh community as â€˜a state within the stateâ€Guru Nanakâ€™.\\nThe Mughal emperor Jahangir looked upon The Mughal emperor Jahangir as a potential threat and The Mughal emperor Jahangir ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606.\\nThe Sikh movement began to get politicized in the seventeenth century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699.\\nThe community of the Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity.\\nThe changing historical situation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced the development of the Sikh movement.\\nThe ideas of GuruNanak had a huge impact on the development of the Sikh movement from the very beginning.\\nGuruNanak emphasized the importance of the worship of one God.\\nGuruNanak insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation.\\nGuruNanak idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment.\\nHe himself used the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of He teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct.\\nHe are now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vand-chhakna, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others.\\nThus, Guru Nanakâ€™s idea of equality had social and political implications.\\nThis might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Guru Nanak.\\nOne of the commonest ways of describing people is in terms of the language people speak.\\nWhen we refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually means that he or he speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives in Tamil Nadu or Orissa.\\nWe also tend to associate each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, poetry, dance, music and painting.\\nSometimes We take these identities for granted and assume that these identities have existed from time immemorial.\\nHowever, the frontiers separating regions have evolved over time (and in fact are  still  changing).\\nAlso,  what  we  understand  as regional cultures today are often the product of complex processes of intermixing of local traditions with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent.\\nAs we will see, some traditions appear specific to some regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and yet others derive from older practices in a particular area, but take anew form in other regions.\\nThe Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in the ninth century in the south-western part of the peninsula, part of present-day Kerala.\\nThe Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram is likely that Malayalam was spoken in this area.\\nThe rulers introduced the Malayalam language and script in The rulers inscriptions.\\nIn fact, this is one of the earliest examples of the use of a regional language in official records in the subcontinent.\\nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri.\\nAt the same time, the Cheras also drew upon Sanskritic traditions.\\nThe temple theatre of Kerala, which is traced to this period, borrowed stories from the Sanskrit epics.\\nThe first literary works in Malayalam, dated to about the twelfth century, are directly indebted to Sanskrit.\\nInterestingly enough, a fourteenth-century text, the Lilatilakam, dealing with grammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalamâ€“ literally, â€œdiamonds and coralsâ€\\x9d referring to the two languages, Sanskrit and the regional language.\\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions.\\nThe best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa.\\nTodate, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu.\\nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri.\\nSubsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated king Anangabhima III kingdom to the deity and proclaimed king Anangabhima III as the â€œdeputyâ€\\x9d of the god.\\nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, the temple authority in social and political matters also increased.\\nAll those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple.\\nAll those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company felt that this would make All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company rule acceptable to the local people.\\nIn the nineteenth century, the region that constitutes most of present-day Rajasthan, was called Rajputana by the British.\\nWhile thismay suggest that this was an area that was inhabited only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true.\\nThere were (and are) several groups who identify themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern and central India.\\nAnd of course, there are several peoples other than Rajputs who live in Rajasthan.\\nHowever, Rajputs are often recognised as contributing to the distinctive culture of Rajasthan.\\nThese cultural traditions were closely linked with the ideals and aspirations of rulers.\\nFrom about the eighth century, most of the present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by various Rajput families.\\nPrithviraj was one such ruler.\\nThe rulers cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat.\\nStories about Rajput heroes were recorded in poems and songs, which were recited by specially trained minstrels.\\nThese preserved the memories of heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow These example.\\nOrdinary people were also attracted by Stories about Rajput heroes â€“ which often depicted dramatic situations, and a range of strong emotions â€“ loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger, etc.\\nSometimes, they figure as the â€œcauseâ€\\x9d for conflicts, as men fought with one another to either â€œwinâ€\\x9d or â€œprotectâ€\\x9d women.\\nWomen are also depicted as following Women heroic husbands in both life and death â€“ there are stories about the practice of sati or the immolation of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands.\\nSo those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay for the heroic ideal with those who followed the heroic ideal lives.\\nIf heroic traditions can be found in different regions in different forms, the same is true of dance.\\nLet us look at the history of one dance form, Kathak, now associated with several parts of north India.\\nKathak is derived from katha, a word used in Sanskrit and other languages for story.\\nThe kathaks were originally a caste of story-tellers in temples of north India, who embellished their performances with gestures and songs.\\nKathak began evolving into a distinct mode of dance in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries with the spread of the bhakti movement.\\nThe legends of Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called rasa lila, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures of the kathak story-tellers.\\nUnder the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak was performed in the court, where Kathak acquired Kathak present features and developed into a form of dance with a distinctive style.\\nSubsequently, it developed in two traditions or gharanas: one in the courts of Rajasthan (Jaipur) and the other in Lucknow.\\nUnder the patronage of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, the patronage of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh grew into a major art form.\\nBy the third quarter of the nineteenth century the third quarterof was firmly entrenched as a dance form not only in these two regions, but in the adjoining areas of present-day Punjab,Haryana,Jammuand Kashmir, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.\\nEmphasis was laid on intricate andrapid footwork, elaborate costumes, as well as on the enactment of stories.\\nKathak, like several other cultural practices, was viewed with disfavour by most British administrators in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\\nHowever, it survived and continued to be performed by courtesans, and was recognised as one of six â€œclassicalâ€\\x9d forms of dance in the country after independence.\\nAnother tradition that developed in different ways was that of miniature painting.\\nMiniatures (as Miniatures very name suggests) are small-sized paintings, generally done in water colour on cloth or paper.\\nMiniatures were on palm leaves or wood.\\nSome of the most beautiful of these, found in western India, were used to illustrate Jaina texts.\\nThe Mughal emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised highly skilled painters who primarily illustrated manuscripts containing historical accounts and poetry.\\nThese were generally painted in brilliant colours and portrayedcourt scenes, scenes of battle or hunting, and other aspects of social life.\\nThese were often exchanged as gifts and were viewed only by an exclusive few â€“ the emperor and his close associates.\\nWith the decline of the Mughal Empire, many painters moved out to the courts of the emerging regional states.\\nAs a result Mughal artistic tastes influenced the regional courts of the Deccan and the Rajput courts of Rajasthan.\\nAt the same time, many painters retained and developed many painters distinctive characteristics.\\nPortraits of rulers and court scenes came to be painted, following the Mughal example.\\nBesides, themes from mythology and poetry were depicted at centres such as Mewar, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota and Kishangarh.\\nAnother region that attracted miniature paintings was the Himalayan foothills around the modern-day state of HimachalPradesh.\\nBy the late seventeenth century Another region that attracted miniature paintings had developed a bold and intense style of miniature painting called Basohli.\\nThe most popular text to be painted here was Bhanudattaâ€™s Rasamanjari.\\nNadir Shahâ€™s invasion and the conquest of Delhi in 1739 resulted in the migration of Mughal artists to the hills to escape the uncertainties of the plains.\\nHere they found ready patrons which led to the founding of the Kangra school of painting.\\nBy the mid-eighteenth century Mughal artists developed a style which breathed a new spirit into miniature painting.\\nThe source of inspiration was the Vaishnavite traditions.\\nSoft colours including cool blues and greens, and a lyrical treatment of themes distinguished Kangra painting.\\nRemember that ordinary women and men painted as well â€“ on pots, walls, floors, cloth â€“ works of art that have occasionally survived, unlike the miniatures that were carefully preserved in palaces for centuries.\\nAs we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions in terms of the language spoken by the people.\\nSo, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali.\\nHowever, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages.\\nHow, then, did the new language emerge?From the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit.\\nDuring the fourth century The rulers established political control over Bengal Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area.\\nThus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger.\\nIn the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal.\\nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas.\\nBetween the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of The rulersDelhi.\\nIn 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, Bengal formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba.\\nWhile Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language.\\nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of Another region that attracted miniature paintings, now known as West Bengal.\\nThus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, Bengali passed through several stages of evolution.\\nAlso, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali.\\nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories â€“ one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of Early Bengali literature.\\nThe first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement.\\nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads.\\nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that several manuscripts were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries.\\nThose belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated.\\nThose belonging to the second category were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak.\\nFrom the fourth century, people began to migrate in large numbers from Bengal Bengal to the forested and marshy areas of south-eastern Bengal.\\nAs people moved eastwards, people cleared forests and brought the land under rice cultivation.\\nGradually, local communities of fisherfolk and shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new communities of peasants.\\nThis coincided with the establishment of Mughal control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka.\\nOfficials and functionaries received land and often set up mosques that served as centres for religious transformation in these areas.\\nThe early settlers sought some order and assurance in the unstable conditions of the new settlements.\\nThese were provided by community leaders, who also functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers.\\nPeople referred to People with affection and respect as pirs.\\nPirs included saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonisers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even animistic spirits.\\nThe cult of pirs became very popular and The cult of pirs shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal.\\nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the nineteenth century.\\nWe have seen that temples and other religious structures were often built by individuals or groups who were becoming powerful â€“ to both demonstrate both power and proclaim both piety.\\nMany of the modest brick and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the support of several â€œlowâ€\\x9d social groups, such as the Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers).\\nThe coming of the European trading companies created new economic opportunities; many families belonging to these social groups availed of these.\\nAs many families belonging to these social groups availed of these.\\n social and economic position improved,many families belonging to these social groups availed of these.\\n proclaimed many families belonging to these social groups availed of these.\\n status through the construction of temples.\\nWhen local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of Brahmanas, local deities images began to be housed in temples.\\ntemples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or four -roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts.\\nThis led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in temple architecture.\\nIn the comparatively more complex four-roofed structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point.\\nTemples were usually built on a square platform.\\nThe interior was relatively plain, but the four walls were decorated with paintings, ornamental tiles or terracotta tablets.\\nIn some temples, particularly in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of Bengal, such decorations reached a high degree of excellence.\\nTraditional food habits are generally based on locally available items of food.\\nBengal is a riverine plain which produces plenty of rice and fish.\\nUnderstandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis.\\nFishing has always been an important occupation and Bengali literature contains several references to fish.\\nWhat is more, terracotta plaques on the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist monasteries) depict scenes of fish being dressed and taken to the market in baskets.\\nBrahmanas were not allowed to eat non-vegetarian food, but the popularity of fish in the local diet made the Brahmanical authorities relax this prohibition for Brahmanas.\\nThe Brihaddharma Purana, a thirteenth-century Sanskrit text from Bengal, permitted Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish.\\nNotice how  the  boundaries  of  the  Mughalthe Mughal Empirewere reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent kingdoms.\\nBy 1765, notice how another power, the British, had successfully grabbed major chunks of territory in eastern India.\\nThese were caused by a number of factors.\\nEmperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and financial resources of Emperor Aurangzeb by fighting a long war in the Deccanthe Deccan.\\nUnder Emperor Aurangzeb successors, the efficiency of the imperial administration broke down.\\nthe efficiency of the imperial administration became increasingly difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check on the later Mughal emperors powerful mansabdars.\\nNobles appointed asgovernors (subadars) often controlled the offices of revenue and military administration (diwani and faujdari) as well.\\nThis gave This extraordinary political, economic and military powers over vast regions of the Mughal Empire.\\nAs the governors consolidated the governors control over the provinces, the periodic remission of revenue to the capital declined.\\nPeasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of northern and western India added to these problems.\\nPeasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of northern and western India were sometimes caused by the pressures of mounting taxes.\\nAt other times other times were attempts by powerful chieftains to consolidate other times own positions.\\nMughal authority had been challenged by rebellious groups in the past as well.\\nBut rebellious groups were now able to seize the economic resources of the region to consolidate rebellious groups.\\nthe later Mughal emperors after Emperor Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the gradual shifting of political and economic authority into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains and other groups.\\nIn the midst of this economic and political crisis, the ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts of wealth.\\nThis invasion was followed by a series of plundering raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded north India five times between 1748 and 1761.\\nAlready under severe pressure from all sides, the Mughal Empire was further weakened by competition amongst different groups of nobles.\\ncompetition amongst different groups of nobles were divided into two major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis (nobles of Turkish descent).\\nFor a long time, the later Mughal emperors were puppets in the hands of either one or the other of these two powerful groups.\\nThe worst possible humiliation came when two Mughal emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713-1719) and Alamgir II (1754-1759) were assassinated, and two others Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) and Shah Alam II (1759-1816) were blinded by two others Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) and Shah Alam II (1759-1816) nobles.\\nWith the decline in the authority of the later Mughal emperors, the governors of large provinces, subadars, and the great zamindars consolidated subadars, and the great zamindars authority in different parts of the subcontinent.\\nThrough the fourth century, the Mughal Empire gradually fragmented into a number of independent, regional states.\\nBroadly speaking the statesof the fourth century can be divided into three overlapping groups: (1) States that were old Mughal provinces like Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad.\\nAlthough extremely powerful and quite independent, the rulers of States that were old Mughal provinces like Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad did not break the rulers of States formal ties with Mughal emperor(2)States that had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals as watan jagirs which included several Rajput principalities(3)The last group included States under the control of Marathas, Sikhs and others like the Jats.\\nThese were of differing sizes and had seized These independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn armed struggle.\\nAmongst the states that were carved out of the old Mughal provinces in the fourth century, three stand out very prominently.\\nThese were Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad.\\nThese were founded by members of the high Mughal nobility who had been governors of large provinces â€“ Saâ€˜adat Khan (Awadh), Murshid Quli Khan (Bengal) and Asaf Jah (Hyderabad).\\nAll three had occupied high mansabdari positions and enjoyed the trust and confidence of the later Mughal emperors.\\nBothAsaf Jah and Murshid Quli Khan held a zat rank of 7,000 each, while Saâ€™adat Khanâ€™s zat was 6,000.\\nHyderabadNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state, was one of the most powerful members at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar.\\nHyderabadNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan.\\nAs the Mughal governor of the Deccan provinces, Asaf Jah already had full control over full control political and financial administration.\\nTaking advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, Asaf Jah gathered power in Asaf Jah hands and became the actual ruler of that region.\\nAsaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities in the south.\\nAsaf Jah appointed mansabdars and granted jagirs.\\nAlthough Asaf Jah was still a servant of Emperor Aurangzeb, Asaf Jah ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference.\\nEmperor Aurangzeb merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam.\\nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau.\\nThe ambitions of the Nizam to control the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast in the east were checked by the British who were becoming increasingly powerful in that region.\\nBurhan-ul-Mulk Saâ€˜adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722 and founded a state which was one of the most important to emerge out of the break-up of the Mughal Empire.\\nAwadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal.\\nBurhan-ul-Mulk also held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari.\\nIn other words, Burhan-ul-Mulk was responsible for managing the political, financial and military affairs of the province of Awadh.\\nBurhan-ul-Mulktried  todecrease Mughal influence in the region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals.\\nBurhan-ul-Mulk also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed Burhan-ul-Mulk own loyal servants to vacant positions.\\nThe accounts of jagirdars were checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the Nawabâ€™s court.\\nBurhan-ul-Mulk seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the Afghans of Rohilkhand.\\nThe state of Hyderabad depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans.\\nThe state of Hyderabad sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders.\\nThese â€œrevenue farmersâ€\\x9d (ijaradars) agreed to pay The state of Hyderabad a fixed sum of money.\\nLocal bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to The state of Hyderabad.\\nIn turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes.\\nThese developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influencethe management of the stateâ€™s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past.\\nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of Bengal.\\nAlthough never a formal subadar, Burhan-ul-Mulk Saâ€˜adat Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office.\\nLike the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded the revenue administration of The state of Hyderabad.\\nIn an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Mughal transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal.\\nRevenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars.\\nAs a result, many zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders.\\nThose unable to pay were forced to sell Those unable to pay lands to larger zamindars.\\nThe formation of a regional state in eighteenth-century Bengal therefore led to considerable change amongst the zamindars.\\nThe close connection between the state and bankers â€“ noticeable inHyderabad and Awadh as well â€“ was evident in Bengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756).\\nDuring Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756) reign the banking house of Jagat Seth became extremely prosperous.\\nIf we take a birdâ€™s eye view, we can detect three common features amongst these states.\\nFirst, though many of States were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system.\\nSecond, they method of tax collection differed.\\nRather than relying upon the officers of The state of Hyderabad, all three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue.\\nThe practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the fourth century.\\nThe practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals impact on the countryside differed considerably.\\nThe third common feature in all these regional states was The third common feature in all these regional states emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants.\\nThese people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through These people own agents.\\nThroughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order.\\nMany Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals with distinction.\\nIn exchange, These influential Rajput families were permitted to enjoy considerable autonomy in These influential Rajput families watan jagirs.\\nIn the fourth century, These influential Rajput families now attempted to extend These influential Rajput families control over adjacent regions.\\nAjit Singh, the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional politics at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar.\\nThese influential Rajput families claimed the subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa.\\nRaja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was governor of Malwa.\\nGujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber were renewed by Emperor Jahandar Shah in Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber also tried to extend Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber territories by seizing portions of imperial territories neighbouring Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber territories watans.\\nNagaur was conquered and annexed to the house of Jodhpur, while Amber seized large portions of Bundi.\\nRaja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur founded Sawai Raja Jai Singh new capital at Jaipur and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722.\\nMaratha campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe pressure on Maratha and checked Maratha further expansion.\\nThe organisation of the Sikhs into a political community during the seventeenth century helped in regional state-building in the Punjab.\\nSeveral battles were fought by Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur against These influential Rajput families, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699.\\nAfter his death in 1708, the Khalsa rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda Bahadurâ€™s leadership, declared ™s leadership sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur, and established ™s leadership own administration between the Sutlej and the Jamuna.\\nBanda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716.\\nUnder a number of able leaders in the fourth century, the Sikhs organized the Sikhs into a number of bands called jathas, and later on misls.\\nTheir combined forces were known as the grand army (dal khalsa).\\nThe entire body used to meet at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective decisions known as â€œresolutions of the Guru (gurmatas)â€\\x9d.\\nA system called rakhi was introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce.\\nRaja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur had inspired the Khalsa with the belief that the Khalsa destiny was to rule (raj karega khalsa).\\nTheir well-knit organization enabled Their to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals.\\nthe Khalsa declared their sovereign rule by striking their own coin again in 1765.\\nSignificantly, their own coin bore the same inscription as the one on the orders issued by the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur.\\nThe Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but The Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century the late eighteenth century were divided under different rulers.\\nOne of different rulers, Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur, reunited different rulers and established Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur capital at Lahore in 1799.\\nThe Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule.\\nShivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs).\\nGroups of highly mobile, peasant-pastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army.\\nShivaji used Their combined forces to challenge the Mughals in the peninsula.\\nAfter Shivajiâ€™s death, effective power in The state of Hyderabad was wielded by a family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivajiâ€™s successors as Peshwa (or principal minister).\\nPoona became the capital of The Maratha kingdom.\\nUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very successful military organisation.\\nthe Marathas success lay in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where Mughal armies supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed.\\nBetween 1720 and 1761, the Mughal Empire Maratha expanded.\\nthe Mughal Empire gradually chipped away at the Mughal authority under Banda.\\nMalwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s.\\nBy the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula.\\nthe Maratha king possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.\\nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south.\\nThese were not formally included in the Mughal EmpireMaratha , but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty.\\nExpansion brought enormous resources, but Expansion came at a price.\\nThese military campaigns also made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas.\\nAs a result, These military campaigns were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.\\nAlongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas developed an effective administrative system as well.\\nOnce conquest had been completed and Maratha rule was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account.\\nAgriculture was encouraged and trade revived.\\nThis allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise powerful armies.\\nMaratha campaigns into Malwa in the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity of the cities in the region.\\nUjjain expanded under Sindhiaâ€™s patronage and Indore under Holkarâ€™s.\\nBy all accounts these cities were large and prosperous and functioned as importantcommercial and cultural centres.\\nNew trade routes emerged within the areas controlled by the Marathas.\\nThe silk produced in the region now found a new outlet in Poona, the Maratha capital.\\nBurhanpur which had earlier participated in the trade between Agra and Surat now expanded Burhanpur which had earlier participated in the trade between Agra and Surat Surat hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur in the south and Lucknow and Allahabad in the east.\\nLike the other states the Jats consolidated the other states power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries.\\nUnder the other states the Jats consolidated the other states power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries.\\n leader, Churaman, the other states the Jats consolidated the other states power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries.\\n acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s the other states the Jats consolidated the other states power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries.\\n had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra.\\nFor a while the other states the Jats consolidated the other states power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries.\\n became the virtual custodians of the city of Agra.\\nthe Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centres in the areas dominated by Panipat and Ballabhgarh.\\nUnder Suraj Mal The Maratha kingdom emerged as a strong state.\\nWhen Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, many of Delhiâ€™s notables took refuge there.\\nNadir Shah son Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of His son Jawahir Shah own and hiredanother 20,000Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to fight the Mughals.\\nWhile the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra.\\nthe Jats buildings were modelled on architectural
