      "After the Tughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from Delhi and Agra. By then, Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the entire south India had independent rulers who established flourishing states and prosperous capitals. This was also the period which saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the Afghans and the Rajputs.Some of the states established in this period were small but powerful and extremely well administered. Sher Shah Sur  started his career as the manager of a small territory for his uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun. Sher Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty. Although the Suri dynasty ruled for only fifteen years, it introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin Khalji and made them more efficient. Sher Shah’s administration became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar   when he consolidated the Mughal Empire.\n"
