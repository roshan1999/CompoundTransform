      " Before we can explore the details of computer system operation, we need to know something about system structure. We thus discuss the basic functions of system startup and storage early in this chapter.  We also describe the basic computer architecture. it makes it possible to write a functional operating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " an operating system is large and complex. it must be created piece by piece . Each of these pieces should be a well-delineated portion of the system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions. In this chapter, we provide a general overview of the major components of a contemporary computer system as well as the functions provided by the operating system. Additionally, we cover several other topics to help set the stage for the remainder of this text: data structures used in operating systems, computing environments, and open-source operating systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " We begin our discussion by looking at the operating system’s role in the overall computer system. A computer system can be divided roughly into four components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs, and the users (Figure 1. 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " The hardware —the central processing unit (CPU) and the input/output (I/O) devices —provides the basic computing resources for the system. The application programs —such as word processors, spreadsheets, compilers, and Web browsers— define the ways in which these resources are used to solve users’ computing problems. The operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware and data. The operating system provides the means for proper use of these resources in the operation of the computer system. An operating system is similar to a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function by itself. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " To understand more fully the operating system’s role, we next explore operating systems from two viewpoints: that of the user and that of the system.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " The user’s view of the computer varies according to the interface being used. Most computer users sit in front of a PC, consisting of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and system unit. Such a system is designed for one user.\n",

In this case with some attention paid to performance and none paid to resource utilization — how various hardware and software resources are shared. Performance is important to the user; but such systems are optimized for the single-user experience rather than the requirements of multiple users.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In other cases, a user sits at a terminal connected to a mainframe or a minicomputer. Other users are accessing the same computer through other terminals. These users share resources and may exchange information. The operating system in such cases is designed to maximize resource utilization— to assure that all available CPU time and I/O are used efficiently and that no individual user takes more than her fair share.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In still other cases, users sit at workstations connected to networks of other workstations and servers. These users have dedicated resources at their disposal, but they also share resources such as networking and servers, including file, compute, and print servers. Therefore, their operating system is designed to compromise between individual usability and resource utilization. Recently, many varieties of mobile computers, such as smartphones and tablets, have come into fashion. Most mobile computers are standalone units for individual users. Quite often, they are connected to networks through cellular or other wireless technologies. Increasingly, these mobile devices are replacing desktop and laptop computers for people who are primarily interested in using computers for e-mail and web browsing. The user interface for mobile computers generally features a touch screen, where the user interacts with the system by pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a.\n",

      "\n",

      " Some computers have little or no user view. For example but they and their operating systems are designed primarily to run without user intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " From the computer’s point of view, the operating system is the program most intimately involved with the hardware. In this context, we can view an operating system as a resource allocator.  A computer system has many resources. many resources may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space, file-storage space, I/O devices, and so on. The operating system acts as the manager of these resources. Facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests for resources, the operating system must decide how to allocate them to specific programs and users so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and fairly. we have seen. resource allocation is especially important where many users access the same mainframe or minicomputer .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " A slightly different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to control the various I/O devices and user programs. An operating system is a control program. A control program manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.\n",

Before we can explore the details of computer system operation, we need to know something about system structure. we thus discuss the basic functions of system startup and storage early in this chapter.  we also describe the basic computer architecture. the basic computer architecture makes it possible to write a functional operating system. an operating system is large and complex. an operating system must be created piece by piece . Each of these pieces should be a well-delineated portion of an operating system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions. In this chapter, we provide a general overview of the major components of a contemporary computer system as well as the functions provided by the operating system. Additionally, we cover several other topics to help set the stage for the remainder of this text: data structures used in operating systems, computing environments, and open-source operating systems. we begin we discussion by looking at the operating system’s role in the overall computer system. A computer system can be divided roughly into four components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs, and the users (Figure 1. 1). The hardware —the central processing unit (CPU) and the input/output (I/O) devices —provides the basic computing resources for A computer system. The application programs —such as word processors, spreadsheets, compilers, and Web browsers— define the ways in which these resources are used to solve users’ computing problems. the operating system controls the hardware and coordinates the operating system use among the various application programs for the various users. We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware and data. the operating system provides the means for proper use of these resources in the operation of the computer system. An operating system is similar to a government. Like a government, An operating system performs no useful function by An operating system. An operating system simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work. To understand more fully the operating system’s role, we next explore operating systems from two viewpoints: that of the user and that of the operating system. The user’s view of the computer varies according to the interface being used. Most computer users sit in front of a PC, consisting of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and system unit. Such a system is designed for one user. to monopolize Such a system resources. The goal is to maximize the work (or play) that the user is performing. In this case with some attention paid to performance and none paid to resource utilization — how various hardware and software resources are shared. Performance is important to the user; but such systems are optimized for the single-user experience rather than the requirements of multiple users. In other cases, a user sits at a terminal connected to a mainframe or a minicomputer. Other users are accessing the same computer through other terminals. Other users share resources and may exchange information. The operating system in such cases is designed to maximize resource utilization— to assure that all available CPU time and I/O are used efficiently and that no individual user takes more than her fair share. In still other cases, users sit at workstations connected to networks of other workstations and servers. Other users have dedicated resources at Other users disposal, but Other users also share resources such as networking and servers, including file, compute, and print servers. Therefore, Other users operating system is designed to compromise between individual usability and resource utilization. Recently, many varieties of mobile computers, such as smartphones and tablets, have come into fashion. Most mobile computers are standalone units for individual users. Quite often, Most mobile computers are connected to networks through cellular or other wireless technologies. Increasingly, these mobile devices are replacing desktop and laptop computers for people who are primarily interested in using computers for e-mail and web browsing. The user interface for mobile computers generally features a touch screen, where the user interacts with the system by pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a. physical keyboard and mouse. Some computers have little or no user view. For example but Some computers and Some computers operating systems are designed primarily to run without user intervention. From the computer’s point of view, the system is the program most intimately involved with the hardware. In this context, we can view an operating system as a resource allocator.  A computer system has many resources. many resources may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space, file-storage space, I/O devices, and so on. A computer system acts as the manager of many resources. Facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests for resources, A computer system must decide how to allocate numerous and possibly conflicting requests for resources to specific programs and users so that A computer system can operate A computer system efficiently and fairly. we have seen. resource allocation is especially important where many users access the same mainframe or minicomputer . A slightly different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to control the various I/O devices and user programs. An operating system is a control program. A control program manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.'"
